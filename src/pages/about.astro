  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>
  <p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
    on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
  </p>
  <p>
    This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
    back and see how my journey is going!
  </p>

  <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My name is {my.firstName}.</li>
    <li>I live in {my.country} and work as a {my.occupation}.</li>
    {
      my.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
        <li>
          Two of my hobbies are: {my.hobbies[0]} and {my.hobbies[1]}
        </li>
      )
    }
  </ul>

  <p>My skills are:</p>
  <style define:vars={{ skillColor, fontWeight, textCase }}>
    .skill {
      color: var(--skillColor);
      font-weight: var(--fontWeight);
      text-transform: var(--textCase);
    }
  </style>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>

  {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}
  {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}
  <p>My goal is to finish in {goal > 3 && ">"}{goal < 3 && "<"} 3 days.</p>
</BaseLayout>
